<p style="font-family:helvetica;"><a href="http://www.cad-comic.com/"><i>Ctrl+Alt+Del</i></a> is a video-game themed comic by <a href="Tim Buckley.html">Tim Buckley</a>. The comic tends to alternate between <a href="gag-a-day.html">gag-a-day</a> <a href="parody.html">parody</a> strips depicting various video game situations and an ongoing <a href="slice of life.html">slice of life</a> storyline revolving around original gamer characters created by Buckley, though the overall tone stays primarily <a href="comedy.html">comedic</a> throughout. The comic updates Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

<h2 style="font-family:helvetica;">Main Cast</h2>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">Ethan McManus: A hardcore gamer and idiot-savant. Known for being extremely childish and immature. Somehow manages to become the owner of a game shop.</p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">Lucas Davidovicz: Ethan's levelheaded best friend and a huge gamer in his own right. A bit of a slacker, Lucas dreams of working in the video game industry as a programmer, but never possessed the ambition to pursue this dream. Currently works for Ethan.</p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">Lilah McManus: Ethan's wife, and perhaps the best gamer out of the core trio. A former office assistant, she's lately found work as a professional gamer, competing in first-person shooter tournaments and doing quite well.</p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">Zeke: Formerly known as X-bot, Zeke is a sentient Xbox created by Ethan. Plays the straight man to the various antics of the rest of the cast. Harbors repressed violent tendencies, especially towards Ethan.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:helvetica;">Plot</h2>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">The main plotline centered around the lives of the core 3 protagonists, starting with just Ethan and Lucas. Ethan eventually started dating and then married Lilah, and with the accidental creation of Zeke, the core cast was complete.</p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">Outside of the events listed on each character's cast bio, the most notable plotline of the comic is the infamous Loss arc, in which the pregnant Lilah miscarried. This resulted in a comic titled Loss, a wordless comic in which Ethan rushes to the hospital to find Lilah lying on her side, crying. Many internet users consider this to have been clumsily handled, and has resulted in many memes.</p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">In 2012, Buckley formally drew an end to the "main" plot of CAD, killing off Ethan and giving closure to the rest of the cast. The comic then focused solely on the gag-a-day aspect until Buckley announced in 2015 that he would be rebooting the comic, featuring altered versions of the main characters in an entirely new universe.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:helvetica;">History</h2>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">The first page was posted on October 23, 2002. Updating 3 times a week since its inception, it is known for hardly ever missing an update.</p>
<p style="font-family:helvetica;">The comic has drawn criticism over, among other things, its use of reused assets in its art, its dialogue-heavy writing, and poor blending of comedy and drama. CAD is cited by some as a negative example of the "two gamers on a couch" genre popularized by <i>Penny Arcade</i>.</p>
